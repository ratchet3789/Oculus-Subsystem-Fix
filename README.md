# Oculus Subsystem Fix
Fix for Oculus Subsystem (https://issues.unrealengine.com/issue/UE-82549)

## How To Install
This is just an Unreal 4 Plugin. To install it
 - go to your projects directory (the location where the .uproject exists)
 - Create a new folder called Plugins
 - Create a new folder in Plugins called OnlineSubsystemOculus
 - Drag the data from this folder into the OnlineSubsystemOculus folder
 - Run your project
 
### Todo
I will create a sample project based around this in the future with Quest/Rift support
